# Epidemic Calculator

## Overview
The Epidemic Calculator is a simple GUI application written in Python that utilizes the SEAIR model (Susceptible → Exposed → Asymptomatic → Infected → Removed) to simulate the spread of infectious diseases. It aims to provide a tool for understanding and contextualizing epidemiological parameters and forecasts, particularly in the context of global health crises like the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).

## Features
- SEAIR model simulation
- Graphical representation of disease spread over time
- Adjustable epidemiological parameters
- Intuitive user interface

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `epidemic_calculator.py` file to start the application.
4. Adjust the parameters as needed and click "Run Simulation" to visualize the disease spread.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Matplotlib
